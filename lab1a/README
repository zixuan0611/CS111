lab1a.c :
This is a single C source module that performs terminal I/O and
Inter-Process Communication. I defined several global variables
and some functions to use. I set up a global variable: shell_flag,
which is essential for many parts of the implementation, especially
in main function.

This is a Makefile that supports three options: default, clean, dist.
It is basically used to compiled the program.
